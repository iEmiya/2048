# 2048 AI
A framework for creating AIs for [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048).

## Instructions
All AI code is in ai.js. So edit that.

The AI object will be instantiated with the current grid - this may or may not be empty depending on when the AI is instantiated (and it may be destroyed and instantiated at any point in the game).

The move function will be called each turn and must return 0 (UP), 1 (RIGHT), 2 (DOWN), or 3 (LEFT).

To use the AI, open index.html in the browser and press "Next Move" to have the AI make a single move, or "Play" to start the AI playing the rest of the game.
